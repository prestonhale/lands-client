TODO:
- Code generation for SerializerCell serializers.
- Game plays best at 250% on my screen. Roughly synchronize that for all screens. (Consider hi-res tiles?)
- [DONE] Consider 'bump-to-target' instead of manual directional aiming.
- General coding: finish root level method first then implement missing methods?
- Movement speeds. Should generally be a bit slower. Packs should slow you significantly.
- Better serialization of map data. Represent tiles/resources in 2 bytes (2 bytes each?)
- Transport. Vehicles that carry you to camps. 
- Camp setup being larger and taking more time. Players should be able to use each others camps. (Consider griefers. Can you block a resource by placing camps).
- Resources currently block all movement. Consider making a double-move into a resource allow the player to move through some (like reeds). Maybe holding shift moves you through them by default.
