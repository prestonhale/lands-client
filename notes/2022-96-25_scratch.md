TODO:
- Code generation for SerializerCell serializers.
- Game plays best at 250% on my screen. Roughly synchronize that for all screens. (Consider hi-res tiles?)
- Consider 'bump-to-target' instead of manual directional aiming.
- General coding: finish root level method first then implement missing methods?
