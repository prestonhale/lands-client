## Class Fantasy

Well not -class- fantasy specifically, but certainly some kind of fantasy.

- Exploration is the focus of the game. 
- Vitally, player's are NOT limited in their exploration. E.g. No thirst meter that forces you to go back.
- BUT, you player's are encouraged to slowly expand their level of comfort.
- Player's are encouraged to build an "area" of comfort. This is a -physical- area of the game map. Two ideas here:
    - Have the player ephemerally improve the area. E.g. mark good trees, cause high quality trees to 
- This is absolutely NOT a farming game. Resources are found in the wild not in plots.
- Resources are a "big deal". No quests like "chop 300 trees".  That's not how you level either. "Harvesting" is a considered activity.
- **Return trips**. Players are -constantly- on the move. No play session should involve logging on in one place, doing an action, and logging off. Players are encouraged to explore, transport, return to town, restock and head out again.
- **Think artisinal**. The "farmer's market" of crafting games. Resources are "hand-picked". "Lovingly hand-picked" even. No "craft 100 more picks to level up" here.
    - Challenge: Games are intrinsically about "doing the same thing over and over again". How do you give heft to the act of crafting.
- A product's crafter matters. All axes are not equal. 
    - Challenge: There's not much in the way of aesthetics in the game right now. You can't exactly sign your name in an axe. This may be ok as the qualities associate with an item.

## General Flow
Explore, examine, select, harvest, craft, expand knowledge.

## User Stories
- (6) "I'm heading into the desert because I found a stand of cacti that will yield good quality wood."
- (5) "I've found some rare minerals and am starting an expedition to retrieve them and bring them back to base."
- "I've specialized my character in mountain ore gathering. While I can and do work anywhere, I have unique bonuses to mountaintop gathering."

## Objects 
- Resource: Anything harvestable.
- Resource Pack: The end result of harvesting. Can only carry/move a limited amount at a time.
- Resource Platform: Where resources are deposited to begin crafting.
- Resource Warehouse: Prevents degradation of resources while they are stored there.

## Inspiration
- Runescape
    - **Sense of space**. Knowing "cows are here and they give me leather", "the onion farm is here", "a great mine is just north of this town" is great. It gives the world a sense of utility outside of "things to kill".
    - **Interleaved Crafting**. Mining made arrowheads which were used in fletching. Herblore was used for most skilling. 
    - **Restrictive Inventory**. Running out of inventory space was one of -the- primary ways Runescape forced "return trips".
    - **Truly Unique Gathering Skills**. Evey single ability boils down to clicking. YET, every ability is completely and uniquely different. Think archeaology that wove right into the existing world and felt super different than any other gathering skill. Additionally, almost every level unlocks something new.
- Archeage
    - **Open-World Housing**. While housing exactly isn't something we're aiming at here, the general sense of housing areas interwoven with the rest of the playable space was wonderful.
    - **Public transit**. Airships and carriages with set routes (they even looked like subway lines on the map!) to enable faster good transport was great.
- Star Wars Galaxies
    - **Open-World Harvesting** In addition to housing, crafters could scan throughout the wide-open world for harvesting locations with good quality resources.
    - **Goods of varying quality** As above, when crafting the resource quality mattered. There were multiple qualities such as heat resistance, "conducivity" and more.

## Random Non-Committal Ideas
- Players can't benefit from higher level resources without better equipment or higher levels. 

    - Either certain resources entirely or maybe just the upper tiers of quality bars are locked to you until you specialize in that resource.

- Approach the initial design as though the player was already mid-level.

- Degradation? Do items need to be repaired.

- No inventory? Resources are physical and need to transported.

- Make each crafting profession operate in different ways. Chopping a tree is different from slicing a cactus.

- Investigate weird old-timey crafting from hunter-gatherer tribes onwards. Get away from just wood, stone, plants as resources. More fantasy and sci-fi elements? Weird shit always.

- First game objective?

- Resource quality degrades when transported (per square or over time?) making efficient -return- trips crucial but allowing as much transport as you'd like. 

- Big question: How much of progression is "new resource types" vs "better quality" unlocked. Is it "unlocked bigger cactuses" or "unlocked more uses for standard cactuses". Higher quality resources -will- always be less accessible.
    
- Starting to get a sense of flow here:
    - Find a good resource area.
    - Harvest. (This will look different depending on the resource)
    - Store at a resource warehouse (these are scattered through the world and potentially placeable by players). This prevents the resource from degrading while you harvest more.
    - Transport the multiple resources back as efficiently as possible.

- **Crafting Spots Exist in the Actual World** E.g. if you want to build a boat you have to bring wood to the dock.

- Player growth?
    - By level or only through items?
    - What about you gain the ability to see better qualities intrisically which allows you to craft better things.
    - ^ If this is the case there needs to a consolidation price for lower quality stuff. E.g. **you can merge low quality stuff back into high quality. ** <- I like this. -me to me This way if you arrive at the dock to find your quality degraded too far to make what you want you can still create a very high quality log.
    - Make sure that quality is not ONLY used to determine whether you can craft something but also attributes of the thing. A boat may require 20 hardness but more lightness should also increase the speed.
    - A challenge here is that making things will be used just to promote player growth rather than be an ends to themselves, this is bad.
    - I want to be able to be "a desert guy". Maybe my skill is still woodcutting but I want to be able to focus on a type of plant that I get unique benefits. A skill tree, or better yet, specialized tool would be ideal for this. 
    - Leaning towards gear based progression atm. Gear can be -fused- to character. 
    - Maybe even you need to select your tool before heading out.

- Skill Brainstorm
    - Gathering and Crafting are generally going to go together.
    - Mining/Smithing
    - Woodcutting/WoodWorking
    - Fishing/Cooking...Fish?
        - Probably generally avoid animal murder? Catching things that aren't fish? Fish grant wished? There's more interesting stuff there.
    - Crystallized water.
    - Cactus Seeds/X

- Woodworking
    - Cactus -hardness +flexibility
    - Pine Tree +hardness -flexibility
    - 
- Challenge: Representing Weird Shit (tm) is much harder in a simple pixel form than something 3d. Start with easily readable and move up from there.

- **Perks System** Maybe qualities are simply a way to increase (or allow) the roll of a specific perk for your item. Bascially destiny but you can sway the odds in your favor. This turns every craft into a random roll that you can influence. Bad-luck protection is a must. Maybe destroying a roll gives you something that sways the next roll in your favor.
    - More flexibility: Higher odds of a speed perk.
    - More hardness: Higher odds of a durability perk.
